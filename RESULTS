The system architecture of the proposed UAV swarm communication framework is strategically 
designed to integrate the high-capacity benefits of Free Space Optical (FSO) communication with the 
resilience and security of Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) modulation. This combination enables 
the swarm to function efficiently in complex, dynamic environments where traditional communication 
systems may be limited due to bandwidth, interference, or security constraints. The architecture is 
structured in a layered and modular format, supporting scalability, adaptability, and robustnessâ€”
qualities essential for swarm-based applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and autonomous 
mission execution.
